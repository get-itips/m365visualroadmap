## ◉ M365 Visual Roadmap
This project began as a personal initiative and was later made public for anyone interested in exploring the Microsoft 365 Roadmap in a visual format.

## How to use
Click on any product that you are interested on, it should load its roadmap items for the General Availability ring in a timeline format.
Roadmap files are generated daily at 12:00 UTC. If you find any issues please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
